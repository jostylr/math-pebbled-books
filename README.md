# Math Pebbled Books

This a repository containing math books that I created in tandem with my math
pebbles project and generally wandering. We shall see just how far we get in
it. 

When one book has some amount of material, it will be pandoc'd into a PDF and
uploaded to Leanpub for purchase.  Obviously, one can download this repository
and create your own PDFs. Feel free to do so as you desire, but please do not
redistribute these for money.

To date, we have: 

1. Rational Trigonometry, first chapter. This is an attempt to make a more
   approachable print version of Norman Wildberger's Rational Trigonometry
   materials.  Rational Trigonometry is the idea that we do not need the
   transcendental trigonometric functions to answer our planar geometry
   problems.
